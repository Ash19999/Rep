     <p id="Book">My favorite Book is "Hello Lighthouse" by Sophie Blackall. The book describes as the Waves roll by, seasons come and go, keepers tend to their duties, and through it all, the lighthouse stands tall, sending its beam out into the darkness, bidding hello to all the ships at sea. Caldecott winner Sophie Blackall does a gorgeous job showing the timeless nature of lighthouse life — and the change that's coming..</p>

  <h1>My Work</h1>
      <h1> Code is a form of writing that isn’t binary, that is easy to learn and interpret for humans, but that the computer can still understand. For most of the programs you’re likely to work on, the code you write is actually a step removed from the binary code that the computer will process. You’ll write in a code that pulls from human language ...Coding is a list of step-by-step instructions that get computers to do what you want them to do. Coding makes it possible for us to create computer software, games, apps and websites. Coders, or programmers, are people who write the programmes behind everything we see and do on a computer.</h1>
